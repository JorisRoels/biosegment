With an administrator account, extra interfaces are available in the frontend UI e.g. `http://localhost/main/admin/users/all`.

## Manage Users

Here you can view all users and edit their profile. Clicking on the pencil :material-pencil: will allow you to change their e-mail, deactivate the account and set a new password for the user.

## Create User

Here you can add a new user with a valid e-mail account. If you make the user a superuser, they also gain administrator privileges. If the SMPT settings in `.env` are not in use or invalid, notify the user of their account credentials manually.
