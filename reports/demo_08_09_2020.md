# Demo

## Demo talkpoints

- folder structure
    - EM
        - raw datasets (PNG series)
    - models
        - machine learning models like neuralnets
    - segmentations
        - ground truth labelling or model output
    - annotations (future)
        - handdrawn corrections and hints
- backend with database
- create a dataset from EM folder and ground truth segmentation
- run a segmentation job on the dataset
- retrain the model with a segmentation (no UI)
- view new segmentations

## Future features

- demo ["Interactive Machine Learning: Image Segmentation"](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-image-segmentation/)
- demo ["3D Image Annotation"]()
- bio-formats for file conversion
- webKnossos

## Future feature priorities

This week:

- better support for adding new datasets
- better support for using segmentation output

- support for classes of interest
- update viewer with annotation features like in demo
- retrain model with annotations

Future:

- add bio-formats conversion tasks
- add more capable viewer (3D, superpixel...)
- add external UIs (webKnossos, catmaid...)

## Feedback

### Dataset input filetypes

- minimum to get to .png series?
- tiff?

### Segmentation output 

- is series of .png
- minimum other export options needed?

### Classes of interest

- mitos
- ER
    - RER and SER?

- ...?
- maximum?
- color code?

### Annotation interface

- remarks on demo app
