- Workstation to be formatted by IT, couple of days
- work in Windows partition until then

- setup done
    - Docker
    - VS Code
    - Remote dev extension
    - biosegment folder

- priorities
    - create website to automate annotation using neural nets
        - common nework disk access
        - select, push annotate button, save to file
    - add visualization framework
        - API 
        - bio-formats to convert between file formats
        - conversion to Pillow, numpy
    - add third-party vizualizations using this API
        - setup up software
        - prepare input files (bio-formats)
        - point to correct folder
        - export annotations
        - probably out of scope for 3 weeks timeframe
